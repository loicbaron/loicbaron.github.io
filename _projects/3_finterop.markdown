F-Interop allows implementors of IoT protocols to test compliance and interoperability of their implementation by connecting to a remote server in the cloud which contains and runs testing tools for different IoT standards. Testing tools for CoAP, 6TiSCH, OS-CORE and LoRaWAN standards are already available.

The F-Interop project, which has started as a H2020 project funded by the European Commission, is now supported by a large community of standard development organizations, small/large companies, academic institutions, and protocol designers and implementors. They all see the benefits of adopting the new Interoperability approach proposed by F-Interop, which allows to validate IoT implementation faster, reducing time to market, and standardization.
