Easy Access to Testbeds
Through OneLab, you can easily test the software system that you have designed to function in any
one of the following networked communication environments: IoT networks with mobility
and sensing capabilities; ad-hoc wireless and wireless broadband access networks; a global, public, fixed-line Internet; and Cloud and SDN networks. Our platforms offer both wireless and fixed-line emulated environments and reproducibility of experimentation.

### ![iot](/assets/img/onelab-icon-iot.png)  Internet of Things
IoT testing on a large-scale infrastructure
Experiment on hundreds of IoT sensor nodes in mobile and ad hoc environments with LR WPAN (802.15.4 wireless). These platforms offer both fixed nodes and mobile nodes with controlled mobility via robots or model trains.

### ![iot](/assets/img/onelab-icon-wireless.png)  Wireless
Testing for wireless systems and applications
Capabilities include WPAN (Bluetooth), WLAN (Wi-Fi), WWAN (GSM, GPRS, EDGE, 3G, LTE), and cognitive radio. These platforms offer both fixed nodes and mobile nodes with controlled mobility via robots or model trains. Some of the environments are rooms wrapped in Faraday cages, isolated from normal radio interference. Others are in typical office building environments.
